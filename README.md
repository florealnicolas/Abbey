#Abbey

This is a personal project of Nicolas Floréal.
Abbey will be a sort of simulation of the beer brewing-process.

The purpose of the game is to point out that brewing beer is not as easy as it is shown in our daily life. A good beer requires dedication.

First you need to gather some ingredients and those ingredients you can process into requirements for your beer’s recipe.
You are able to gather the ingredients inside your abbey or outside and on your fields you can sow with that ingredient you need.

After some time, you will have a stock of beer and you can sell this for some profit.
The profit can be used to invest in your abbey and by this, you can even produce beers more efficiently.

Not only coin is important, also your abbey’s reputation matters.
This makes it even more realistic and challenging.

Gain reputation by selling beer to people.
As your abbey becomes more popular, your fame attracts more profitable customers.

## The storyline of Abbey

The game will take place in the 16th century.
In time of kings and queens divided by religion.
Still they all had one thing in common, beer.

You'll be a person who is a child of a brewer.
When you were a child, your father died.

After your 22th birthday, you find an old dairy of your father in the tool-shed.
You start to read it and understand that your father was on to something big.
Something about a recipe for a beer that could unite people from different offspring.

The dairy is rather mysteriously written and old so it’s not very readable.
After putting some time in understanding the book, you go to your mother.

She tells you that a monk in the abbey in the mountains can give you more answers on the matter.

So you go to the abbey deep in the mountains.
